TASK2: NUMBER GUESSING GAME
As a part of the java development internship offered by Oasis Infobyte, I have developed a simple number guessing game. I have used VS-Code Editor. We get three attempts to guess the random number generated by the system. On exhaustion of the three attempts, we are asked if we wish to continue playing the game or not, if not we can stop the program or do as instructed in the game.
